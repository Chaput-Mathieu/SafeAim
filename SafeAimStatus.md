# SafeAim
SafeAim is a device made for hunters to help them aim their gun safely. It is a device that is attached to the gun and will decide whether the gun is safe to shoot or not. It will do so by verifying the safety rules of hunting.

What I have done so far :
I have looked into the most important safety rules to implement. For example the 30º rule that will be implemented thanks to a gyroscope.
I have looked for gun locks and found a few that could maybe fit or could probably be modified to fit our needs. The price for the locks I found are mostly around 100€.
I have looked into the cameras I am going to need. I have found some small cameras which is what I would like to use. However they are either expensive or have a low resolution which I think would prevent the recognition of danger from working.
I will need a battery to run the device. This will be chosen when everything will be set.
Lastly for the chip there are a lot that will do the trick since we only need it to store the ai and to run the few modules that will be attached.
